.TH nps-top 1
.SH NAME
nps-top \- constantly display process information
.B nps-top
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nps-top
displays a constantly-updating snapshot of information about processes
running on the system.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB-o \fIFORMAT\fR, \fB-O \fIFORMAT"
Set a specific format.
If multiple \fB-o\fR or \fB-O\fR options are given then they are cumulative.
See \fBFORMATTING\fR below.
.IP "\fB-d \fISECONDS"
Set the time between updates.
The default is 1 second.
.IP \fB-i
Display only non-idle processes.
.IP "\fB-j \fISYSINFO"
Sets the system information format.
See \fBSYSTEM INFORMATION\fR below.
.IP \fB-M
Use megabytes rather than kilobytes.
.IP "\fB-s \fIORDER"
Set the order in which processes are listed.
See \fBSORTING\fR below.
.IP \fB--help
Display a usage message.
.IP \fB--help-format
Displays help for the \fB-o\fR and \fB-s\fR options.
.IP \fB--help-sysinfo
Displays help for the \fB-j\fR option.
.IP \fB--version
Display a version string.
.SH FORMATTING
The \fB-o\fR option specifies a list of process properties to display,
separated by spaces or commas.
The available properties are:
#include formatting.1
.SS Defaults
If no formatting options at all are specified then the default is
equivalent to:
.PP
.RS
\fB-Ouser,pid,nice,rss,pcpu,read,write,tty=TTY,argsbrief=CMD
.RE
.PP
If the calling user is not \fBroot\fR then \fBread\fR and \fBwrite\fR
are omitted.
.PP
If \fB-M\fR was specified then \fBrss\fR is replaced by \fBrssM\fR.
.SH SORTING
The \fB-s\fR option specifies the properties which control the order
in which processes are displayed, separate by spaces or commas.
The available properties are listed above in \fBFORMATTING\fR.
.PP
If more than one property is specified the second and subsequent are
only considered when ordering processes which cannot be distinguished
by the first (and so on).
.PP
Each property name may be prefix with \fB+\fR to specify descending
order (the default) and \fB-\fR to specify ascending order.
.SS Defaults
If no ordering option is specified then the default is equivalent to:
.PP
.RS
\fB-s +pcpu,+io,+rss,+pmem
.RE
.SH "SYSTEM INFORMATION"
The \fB-j\fR option specifies which whole-system properties should be
displayed, separated by spaces or commas.
The available system properties are:
#include sysinfo.1
.PP
These properties are sampled at the same time as collecting process
information, so the \fB-d\fR value defines how out of date they may be.
The exception is \fBtime\fR which always reflects the current time.
.SS Defaults
If \fB-j\fR is not specified then the default is equivalent to:
.PP
.RS
\fB-j time,uptime,processes,load,cpu,mem,swap
.RE
.PP
If \fB-M\fR was specified then \fBmem\fR and \fBswap\fR are replaced
with \fBmemM\fR and \fBswapM\fR.
.SH KEYBOARD
.SS Scrolling
If the terminal is too narrow, the process table can be panned left
and right with the following keys:
.IP "\fBright arrow\fR, \fB^F"
Moves the viewport to the right by one character, i.e. moves the
columns to the left.
.IP "\fBpage down"
Moves the viewport to the right by eight characters.
.IP "\fBleft arrow\fR, \fB^B"
Moves the viewport to the left by one character, i.e. moves the
columns to the right.
.IP "\fBpage up"
Moves the viewport to the left by eight characters.
.IP "\fB^A"
Moves the viewport all the way to the left.
.SS Commands
The following keyboard commands can also be used:
.IP "\fB^L"
Redisplay the screen.
.IP \fBd
Changes the update interval.
Equivalent to the \fB-d\fR option.
.IP \fBh
Displays on-screen help.
Press multiple times to cycle through the help pages and dismiss them.
.IP \fBi
Toggles display of idle processes.
Equivalent to the \fB-i\fR option.
.IP \fBj
Changes the list of whole-system properties.
Equivalent to the \fB-j\fR option.
.IP \fBo
Changes the list of properties to display.
Equivalent to the \fB-O\fR option.
Column headings may be quoted (and must be quoted, if they contain a
space, comma or quotes).
.IP \fBs
Changes the order specification.
Equivalent to the \fB-s\fR option.
.IP \fBq
Quits immediately.
.SS Input
When editing a value (for instance after pressing \fBd\fR) the
following keys can be used:
.IP "\fB^A"
Move the cursor to the start of the line.
.IP "\fBleft arrow\fR, \fB^B"
Move the cursor right.
.IP "\fB^E"
Move the cursor to the end of the line.
.IP "\fBright arrow\fR, \fB^F"
Move the cursor right.
.IP "\fB^L"
Redisplay the screen.
.IP "\fB^U"
Delete all the input.
.IP "\fBescape\fR, \fB^X"
Cancel the operation.
.IP "\fBbackspace\fR, \fB^D"
Delete the character to the left of the cursor.
.IP "\fBdelete"
Delete the character under the cursor.
.IP "\fBreturn"
Commit the operation.
This will only have any effect if the current input is valid.
.IP "\fBup arrow\fR, \fB^P"
Scroll the help up by one line.
.IP "\fBpage up"
Scroll the help up by one page.
.IP "\fBdown arrow\fR, \fB^N"
Scroll the help down by one line.
.IP "\fBpage down"
Scroll the help down by one page.
.SH CONFIGURATION
On startup defaults are read from the file \fB$HOME/.npsrc\fR, if it
exists.
Each line has a \fIKEY\fB=\fIVALUE\fR format, with \fBtop\fR
recognizing the following keys:
.IP \fBtop_delay
The default update interval in seocnds (overridden with the \fB-d\fR
option).
.IP \fBtop_format
The default format (overridden with the \fB-o\fR or \fB-O\fR option).
Headings may be quoted (and must be quoted, if they contain a space,
comma or quotes).
The syntax is the same as when editing with the \fBo\fR key, and
different from the command-line syntax.
.IP \fBtop_order
The default order (overridden with the \fB-s\fR option).
.IP \fBtop_sysinfo
The default system information (overridden with the \fB-j\fR option).
.PP
.SH BUGS
On the first iteration, rate properties such as \fBpcpu\fR are
computed over the process's entire lifetime.
(On subsequent iterations they reflect the usage since the previous
iteration.)
.PP
The meaning of \fBflags\fR is not very clear.

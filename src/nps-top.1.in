.SH NAME

.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nps-top
displays a constantly-updating snapshot of information about processes
running on the system.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB-o \fIFORMAT
Set a specific format.
If multiple \fB-o\fR options are given then they are cumulative.
See \fBFORMATTING\fR below.
.IP \fB-i
Display only non-idle processes.
.IP \fB-I \fISYSINFO
Sets the system information format.
See \fBSYSTEM INFORMATION\fR below.
.IP \fB-s \fIORDER
Set the order in which processes are listed.
See \fBSORTING\fR below.
.IP \fB-d \fISECONDS
Set the time between updates.
The default is 1 second.
.IP \fB-M
Use megabytes rather than kilobytes.
.IP \fB--help
Display a usage message.
.IP \fB--help-format
Displays help for the \fB-o\fR and \fB-s\fR options.
.IP \fB--help-sysinfo
Displays help for the \fB-I\fR option.
.IP \fB--version
Display a version string.
.SH FORMATTING
The \fB-o\fR option specifies a list of process properties to display,
separated by spaces or commas.
The available properties are:
#include formatting.1
.PP
If no formatting options at all are specified then the default is
equivalent to:
.PP
.RS
\fB-o user,pid,nice,rss,pcpu,read,write,tty=TTY -o args=CMD
.RE
.PP
If the calling user is not \fBroot\fR then \fBread\fR and \fBwrite\fR
are omitted.
.PP
If \fB-M\fR was specified then \fBrss\fR is replaced by \fBrssM\fR.
.SH SORTING
The \fB-s\fR option specifies the properties which control the order
in which processes are displayed, separate by spaces or commas.
The available properties are listed above in \fBFORMATTING\fR.
.PP
If more than one property is specified the second and subsequent are
only considered when ordering processes which cannot be distinguished
by the first (and so on).
.PP
Each property name may be prefix with \fB+\fR to specify descending
order (the default) and \fB-\fR to specify ascending order.
.PP
If no ordering option is specified then the default is equivalent to:
.PP
.RS
\fB-s +pcpu,+io,+rss,+vsz
.RE
.SH "SYSTEM INFORMATION"
The \fB-I\fR option specifies which whole-system properties should be
displayed, separated by spaces or commas.
The available system properties are:
#include sysinfo.1
.SH KEYBOARD
.SS Scrolling
If the terminal is too narrow, the process table can be panned left
and right with the following keys:
.IP "\fBright arrow\fR, \fB^F"
Moves the viewport to the right by one character, i.e. moves the
columns to the left.
.IP "\fBpage down"
Moves the viewport to the right by eight characters.
.IP "\fBleft arrow\fR, \fB^B"
Moves the viewport to the left by one character, i.e. moves the
columns to the right.
.IP "\fBpage up"
Moves the viewport to the left by eight characters.
.IP "\fB^A"
Moves the viewport all the way to the left.
.SS Commands
The following keyboard commands can also be used:
.IP "\fB^L"
Redisplay the screen.
.IP \fBd
Changes the update interval.
Equivalent to the \fB-d\fR option.
.IP \fBo
Changes the list of properties to display.
Similar to the \fB-o\fR option except column headings may be quoted
(and must be quoted, if they contain a space, comma or quotes).
.IP \fBs
Changes the order specification.
Equivalent to the \fB-s\fR option.
.IP \fBq
Quits immediately.
.SS Input
When editing a value (for instance after pressing \fBd\fR) the
following keys can be used:
.IP "\fB^A"
Move the cursor to the start of the line.
.IP "\fBleft arrow\fR, \fB^B"
Move the cursor right.
.IP "\fB^E"
Move the cursor to the end of the line.
.IP "\fBright arrow\fR, \fB^F"
Move the cursor right.
.IP "\fB^L"
Redisplay the screen.
.IP "\fB^U"
Delete all the input.
.IP "\fBbackspace\fR, \fB^D"
Delete the character to the left of the cursor.
.IP "\fBdelete"
Delete the character under the cursor.
.IP "\fBescape"
Cancel the operation.
.IP "\fBreturn"
Commit the operation.
This will only have any effect if the current input is valid.
.SH BUGS
On the first iteration, rate properties such as \fBpcpu\fR are
computed over the process's entire lifetime.
(On subsequent iterations they reflect the usage since the previous
iteration.)
.PP
The meaning of \fBflags\fR is not very clear.

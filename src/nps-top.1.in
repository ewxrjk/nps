See \fBFORMATTING\fR below.
.IP \fB-i
Display only non-idle processes.
.IP \fB-I \fISYSINFO
Sets the system information format.
See \fBSYSTEM INFORMATION\fR below.
.IP \fB-s \fOORDER
Set the order in which processes are listed.
See \fBSORTING\fR below.
.IP \fB--help
Display a usage message.
.IP \fB--help-format
Displays help for the \fB-o\fR and \fB-s\fR options.
.IP \fB--help-sysinfo
Displays help for the \fB-I\fR option.
.IP \fB--version
Display a version string.
.SH FORMATTING
The \fB-o\fR option specifies a list of process properties to display,
separated by spaces or commas.
The available properties are:
#include formatting.1
.PP
If no formatting options at all are specified then the default is
equivalent to:
.PP
.RS
\fB-o user,pid,rss,vsz,pcpu,tty=TTY -o time,args=CMD
.RE
.SH SORTING
The \fB-s\fR option specifies the properties which control the order
in which processes are displayed, separate by spaces or commas.
The available properties are listed above in \fBFORMATTING\fR.
.PP
If more than one property is specified the second and subsequent are
only considered when ordering processes which cannot be distinguished
by the first (and so on).
.PP
Each property name may be prefix with \fB+\fR to specify descending
order (the default) and \fB-\fR to specify ascending order.
.PP
If no ordering option is specified then the default is equivalent to:
.PP
.RS
\fB -s +pcpu,+rss,+vsz
.RE
.SH "SYSTEM INFORMATION"
The \fB-I\fR option specifies which whole-system properties should be
displayed, separated by spaces or commas.
The available system properties are:
#include sysinfo.1
.SH BUGS
On the first iteration, \fBpcpu\fR is computed over the process's
entire lifetime.
(On subsequent iterations it reflects the usage since the previous
iteration.)
.PP
The meaning of \fBflags\fR is not very clear.

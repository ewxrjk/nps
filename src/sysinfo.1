.IP \fBcpu
CPU usage information.
The fields are:
.RS
.TP
.B user
The percentage of time spent running all user code.
This includes \fBnice\fR and \fBguest\fR.
.TP
.B nice
The percentage of time spent running niced code.
.TP
.B guest
The percentage of time spent running guest operating systems in a virtual machine.
.TP
.B sys
The percentage of time spent in the kernel.
.TP
.B io
The percentage of time spent blocked on I/O.
.RE
.IP \fBcpus
A line equivalent to \fBcpu\fR for each individual CPU.
.IP \fBidletime
The cumulative time the system has spent idle.
.IP \fBload
The system load averages.
These three figures are the number of tasks either runnable or blocked
on disk IO averaged over 1, 5 and 15 minutes.
.IP
If a parameter is supplied, it controls the number of digits shown
after the decimal point.
The default is 1.
.IP \fBmem
Memory information.
The fields are:
.RS
.TP
.B tot
Total usable memory.
This will be slightly less than the physical memory fitted, as the
kernel and some reserved memory are not included in this figure.
.TP
.B used
Memory currently in use for any purpose.
As above, the kernel is excluded.
.TP
.B free
Memory not in use for any purpose.
.TP
.B buf
Cached blocks.
.TP
.B cache
Cached files.
.RE
.IP
Use \fBmemK\fR or \fBmemM\fR to display kilobytes or megabytes.
.IP \fBprocesses
The current number of processes.
.IP \fBswap
Swap information.
The fields are:
.RS
.TP
.B tot
Total usable swap space.
.TP
.B used
Swap in use.
.TP
.B free
Swap not in use.
.TP
.B cache
Memory both in RAM and in swap.
It can be used or swapped out without IO being required.
.RE
.IP
Use \fBswapK\fR or \fBswapM\fR to display kilobytes or megabytes.
.IP \fBtime
The current time (using the local timezone).
If a parameter is supplied, it is passed to \fBstrftime\fR(3) to
format the time.
.IP \fBuptime
The amount of time since the system booted.

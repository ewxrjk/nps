The following match expressions can be used:

  PROP=VALUE     Exact match against displayed string
  PROP~REGEXP    POSIX extended regular expression match
  PROP<VALUE     Less-than match against value
  PROP<=VALUE    Less-than-or-equal match against value
  PROP>VALUE     Greater-than match against value
  PROP>=VALUE    Greater-than-or-equal match against value
  PROP==VALUE    Equal value
  PROP<>VALUE    Different value

Put a ':' after the operator to avoid confusion with first character of VALUE.

.SS "Column Width"
By default, every column is made wide enough for every value that
appears in it.
.PP
To request a particular width for a column, use the syntax
\fIPROPERTY\fB:\fIWIDTH\fR.
For most properties, requested widths are only advisory; if necessary
columns will be made wider to fit.
However if possible an alternative representation will be used to fit
within the requested width.
For certain properties such as \fBargs\fR requested widths are
mandatory.
.SS "Headings"
To give a property a different heading, use the syntax
\fIPROPERTY\fB=\fIHEADING\fR.
With \fB-o\fR this only works on the last property in a single argument.
Use multiple \fB-o\fR options to work around this.
With \fB-O\fR this can be used on any or all of the properties within
an argument.
If the heading contains spaces or quotes then it must be quoted.
.SS "Time Intervals"
Time intervals (such as \fBetime\fR) are represented as
[[\fIDD\fB-\fR]\fIHH\fB:\fR]\fIMM\fB:\fISS\fR, with \fIDD\fR
representing the number of days, \fIHH\fR the number of hours,
\fIMM\fR the number of minutes and \fISS\fR the number of seconds.
.PP
If a column width is requested then more compact forms may be used:
\fIDD\fB-\fIHH\fR or \fIDD\fBd\fR.
.SS "Timestamps"
Timestamps (such as \fBstime\fR) are represented as
\fIYYYY\fB-\fIMM\fB-\fIDD\fR for times outside than
the current day and \fIHH\fB:\fIMM\fB:\fISS\fR for times during the
current day.
They are always given in the local timezone.
.PP
If a column width is requested then more compact forms may be used:
\fIHH\fB:\fIMM\fR for a time in this day or \fIMM\fB-\fIDD\fR for
a date in this year.
.SS "Understanding Memory Usage"
\fBrss\fR is the resident set size of a process, i.e. the amount
physical RAM it is currently using.
However, some of that RAM may be shared with other processes, for
instance because it is used for the code of a widely used shared
library.
Therefore it can be more useful to look at the \fBpss\fR figure, the
proportional resident set size, in which every page's contribution is
divided by the number of users.
.PP
If you think you are running out of RAM and want a process to blame,
look for high \fBpss\fR figures.
.PP
\fBvsz\fR represents the total virtual memory used by the process.
This includes RAM, swap, files and anonymous mappings.
Since the dynamic linker and some other libraries like to make
inaccessible anonymous mappings, this figure can be quite misleading
as a measure of resource consumption.
.PP
\fBswap\fR represents the amount of swap space used by the process.
This includes both swapped out pages from anonymous mappings and
copy-on-write duplicates of pages mapped from files.
It does not include pages mapped from files that happen not to be in
RAM at the moment.
.PP
\fBmem\fR is the sum of \fBrss\fR and \fBswap\fR.
The same caveats apply regarding shared pages, so \fBpmem\fR, which is
the sum of \fBpss\fR and \fBswap\fR, is likely to be more useful.
.PP
The unadorned memory properties (and IO rates) all append \fBK\fR,
\fBM\fR or \fBG\fR to the figure to indicate what units are in use.
Use \fBrssK\fR, \fBrssM\fR, etc to select particular units.
.PP
The kernel support for gathering \fBpss\fR was added in Linux 2.6.25
and for \fBswap\fR in 2.6.26, so if your kernel is older than that you
will not get the correct figures.

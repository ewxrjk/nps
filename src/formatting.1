format the time.

.SS "Column Width"
By default, every column is made wide enough for every value that
appears in it.
.PP
To request a particular width for a column, use the syntax
\fIPROPERTY\fB:\fIWIDTH\fR.
For most properties, requested widths are only advisory; if necessary
columns will be made wider to fit.
However if possible an alternative representation will be used to fit
within the requested width.
For certain properties such as \fBargs\fR requested widths are
mandatory.
.SS "Parameters"
To give a property a different heading, use the syntax
\fIPROPERTY\fB=\fIHEADING\fR.
With \fB-o\fR this only works on the last property in a single argument.
Use multiple \fB-o\fR options to work around this.
With \fB-O\fR this can be used on any or all of the properties within
an argument.
If the heading contains spaces or quotes then it must be quoted.
.PP
To supply an argument to a property, use the syntax
\fIPROPERTY\fB/\fIPARAMETER\fR.
If the argument contains spaces or quotes then it must be quoted.
.PP
If both a heading and an argument are supplied then the heading must
be first and it must be quoted.
.SS "Time Intervals"
Time intervals (such as \fBetime\fR) are represented as
[[\fIDD\fB-\fR]\fIHH\fB:\fR]\fIMM\fB:\fISS\fR, with \fIDD\fR
representing the number of days, \fIHH\fR the number of hours,
\fIMM\fR the number of minutes and \fISS\fR the number of seconds.
.PP
If a column width is requested then more compact forms may be used:
\fID\fBd\fIHH\fR for a multi-day time, \fIHH\fBh\fIMM\fR for a
multi-hour time or \fIMM\fBm\fISS\fR for sub-hours times.
.PP
These columns can also take a format string as an argument, overriding
the above.
The format string consists of ordinary characters and format
specifications starting with \fB%\fR.
Within the format specification any of the following may appear, in
order, the following modifiers:
.IP \(bu
A minimum field width, as a decimal integer.
If this starts with a \fB0\fR then the field will be padded with
zeroes; otherwise with spaces.
The default minimum field width is 0.
.IP \(bu
A \fB.\fR followed by a minimum digit count, as a decimal integer.
The default minimum digit count is 1.
.IP \(bu
A \fB?\fR indicating that the entire format specification is to be
skipped if the value is 0.
.IP \(bu
A \fB+\fR followed by a single character, which will appear after the
converted result (provided it is not skipped due to a \fB?\fR).
.PP
At the end of the format specification is a single-character
conversion specifier:
.IP \fBd
The total number of days.
.IP \fBh
The total number of hours.
.IP \fBH
The number of hours disregarding any complete days.
.IP \fBm
The total number of minutes.
.IP \fBM
The number of minutes disregarding any complete hours.
.IP \fBs
The total number of seconds.
.IP \fBS
The number of seconds disregarding any complete minutes.
.IP \fB%
Writes a single \fB%\fR.
All modifiers are ignored in this case.
.SS "Timestamps"
Timestamps (such as \fBstime\fR) are represented as
\fIYYYY\fB-\fIMM\fB-\fIDD\fR for times outside than
the current day and \fIHH\fB:\fIMM\fB:\fISS\fR for times during the
current day.
They are always given in the local timezone.
.PP
If a column width is requested then more compact forms may be used:
\fIHH\fB:\fIMM\fR for a time in this day or \fIMM\fB-\fIDD\fR for
a date in this year.
.SS "Memory"
\fBrss\fR is the resident set size of a process, i.e. the amount
physical RAM it is currently using.
However, some of that RAM may be shared with other processes, for
instance because it is used for the code of a widely used shared
library.
Therefore it can be more useful to look at the \fBpss\fR figure, the
proportional resident set size, in which every page's contribution is
divided by the number of users.
.PP
If you think you are running out of RAM and want a process to blame,
look for high \fBpss\fR figures.
.PP
\fBvsz\fR represents the total virtual memory used by the process.
This includes RAM, swap, files and anonymous mappings.
Since the dynamic linker and some other libraries like to make
inaccessible anonymous mappings, this figure can be quite misleading
as a measure of resource consumption.
.PP
\fBswap\fR represents the amount of swap space used by the process.
This includes both swapped out pages from anonymous mappings and
copy-on-write duplicates of pages mapped from files.
It does not include pages mapped from files that happen not to be in
RAM at the moment.
.PP
\fBmem\fR is the sum of \fBrss\fR and \fBswap\fR.
The same caveats apply regarding shared pages, so \fBpmem\fR, which is
the sum of \fBpss\fR and \fBswap\fR, is likely to be more useful.
.PP
The memory properties (\fBrss\fR etc) all support the following arguments:
.IP \fBK
Display in kilobytes.
.IP \fBM
Display in megabytes.
.IP \fBG
Display in gigabytes.
.IP \fBT
Display in terabytes.
.IP \fBP
Display in petabytes.
.IP \fBp
Display in pages.
.IP \fICUTOFF
Display in bytes up to \fICUTOFF\fR kilobytes, in kilobytes up to
\fICUTOFF\fR megabytes and so on up to petabytes.
.PP
With no argument, units are selected as if \fICUTOFF\fR was 1.
.PP
The same applies to I/O rates, except that they are kilobytes per
seconds, etc.
.PP
The kernel support for gathering \fBpss\fR was added in Linux 2.6.25
and for \fBswap\fR in 2.6.26, so if your kernel is older than that you
will not get the correct figures.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nps
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nps
writes a snapshot of information about processes running on the system.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB-a
Select processes which have a controlling terminal.
.IP "\fB-A\fR, \fB-e"
Select all processes.
.IP \fB-d
Select all processes that are not session leaders.
.IP \fB-f
Set the "full" output format.
.IP \fB-l
Set the "long" output format.
.IP \fB-g \fILIST
Select all processes whose sessions are in \fILIST\fR.
.IP \fB-G \fILIST
Select all processes whose real group ID is in \fILIST\fR (by name or
number).
.IP \fB-n \fIANYTHING
Ignored.
.IP \fB-o \fIFORMAT
Set a specific format.
If multiple \fB-o\fR options are given then they are cumulative.
See \fBFORMATTING\fR below.
.IP \fB-p \fILIST
Select all the processes in \fILIST\fR.
.IP \fB-t \fILIST
Select all the processes whose controlling terminals are in \fILIST\fR.
Terminal names may be abbreviated by ommitting the initial \fB/dev\fR.
.IP \fB-u \fILIST
Select all the processes whose effective user ID is in \fILIST\fR (by
name or number).
.IP \fB-U \fILIST
Select all the processes whose real user ID is in \fILIST\fR (by
name or number).
.IP \fB--help
Display a usage message.
.IP \fB--help-format
Displays help for the \fB-o\fR option.
.IP \fB--version
Display a version string.
.PP
All \fILIST\fR options consists of elements separated by spaces or
commas.
.PP
Process selection is cumulative, i.e. if multiple process selection
options are given then the any process which is selected by at least
one of them is selected.
If no selection options are given then only processes that share an
effective UID and terminal with the current process are selected.
.SH FORMATTING
The \fB-o\fR option specifies a list of process properties to display,
separated by spaces or commas.
The available properties are:
#include formatting.1
.PP
If no formatting options at all are specified then the default is
equivalent to:
.PP
.RS
\fB-opid,tty=TTY -otime,comm=CMD
.RE
.PP
The \fB-f\fR option is equivalent to:
.PP
.RS
\fB-ouser=UID -opid,ppid,pcpu=C -ostime,tty=TTY -otime,comm=CMD
.RE
.PP
The \fB-l\fR option is equivalent to:
.PP
.RS
\fB-oflags,state,uid,pid,ppid,pcpu=C -opri,nice,addr,vsz=SZ -owchan,tty=TTY -otime,arg=CMD
.RE
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B COLUMNS
The maximum line length.
If \fBCOLUMNS\fR is not set then window width is used when writing to
a terminal, and no truncation takes place when writing to any other
kind of output.
.SH BUGS
Rate properties such as \fBpcpu\fR is computed over the process's
entire lifetime, which is stretching the definition of "recent".
.PP
The meaning of \fBflags\fR is not very clear.
.SH STANDARDS
Intended to follow SUS v4.

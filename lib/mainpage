 *
 * @subsection process Task Information
 *
 * tasks.h provides the API for raw task information.  (A task means
 * a thread or a process.)
 * - task_enumerate() is used to collect task information.  If any of
 * the properties of interest are rates then tasks are enumerated
 * twice, with a delay between.
 * - For each task property there is a function to retrieve the
 * property.  Property values are cached between enumeration calls.
 *
 * See @ref priv.h for handling of processes properties that are only
 * available to root (or owner).
 *
 * @subsubsection vanish Vanishing Tasks
 *
 * An important concern when enumerating tasks and collecting data
 * about them is that it is not atomic.  Tasks can vanish at any point
 * in the process.  When this happens, the process and all its threads
 * are marked as "vanished".
 *
 * Vanished tasks are never treated as selected, though since they may
 * vanish after selection runs, this doesn't necessaily stop them
 * appearing in the output.
 *
 * Uncollectable properties of vanished tasks are reported as 0.  Rate
 * propertes of a vanished task are reported as 0, even if the
 * necessary data had actually been collected and cached.
 *
 * @subsection select Task Selection
 *
 * selectors.h provides the API for filtering tasks in various ways.
 * - select_add() and select_match() are used to add filters.
 * select_default() is used to set defaults.
 * - They control the set of tasks that will be returned by
 * task_get_selected(), which is used at the start of constructing
 * output.
 * - Note that task_reselect() must be called if the selection changes
 * without re-running task_enumerate().
 *
 * @subsection format Task Formatting
 *
 * format.h provides the API for formatting task information.
 * Output format is defined using the following functions:
 * - format_syntax() and format_set() are used to define the format
 * - @ref format_hierarchy is used to request hierarchical output
 * - format_ordering() is used to control the order in which tasks
 * appear
 *
 * Output is then formatted using the following functions:
 * - format_columns() is used to work out column sizes
 * - format_heading() is used to generate headings
 * - format_task() is used to format each task
 *
 * @subsection sysinfo System Information
 *
 * sysinfo.h provides the API for collecting and reporting system-wide
 * information.  Unlike task information this is not split between
 * multiple headers.
 * - sysinfo_set() is used to define the format
 * - sysinfo_format() is used to format the current system information
 * - sysinfo_reset() is used after time has elapsed to discard cached
 * system information.
